# Slowpost for iOS
Slowpost enables meaningful, modern communication between friends and family. Choose a person to write to, add a photo, compose your message, and then send it! Your Post will be delivered to your friend's phone 2 to 3 days after being sent. Enjoy the deeper form of communication that happens when people stop chatting and start saying something meaningful to each other.

Slowpost is currently in Beta. Features include:

* Import your address book to find contacts who have already registered, or find your friends using their email or username
* Add your own photo to a card, or choose from a gallery of curated images and drawings
